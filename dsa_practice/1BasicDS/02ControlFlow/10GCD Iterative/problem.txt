GCD: Iterative
Description

Write a program that computes the GCD of two positive integers using Euclid's algorithm. Your implementation should be iterative in nature.
Given two positive integers a, b (a >= b), Euclid's algorithm is defined as follows.

GCD(a, b) = b, if b is a divisor of a
          = GCD(b, a%b), otherwise

Input format

First line contains n, the number of test cases.
Next n lines contain two positive integers each. The two integers are separated by a space.
Output format

n lines containing one integer each, which is the greatest common divisor of the corresponding pair of integers from input.
Sample input

2
180 48
105 1001

Sample output

12
7

Explanation

First line contains 2, meaning there are 2 test cases.
First test case is 180 48. The greatest common divisor of 180 and 48 is 12. So, the first line of output is 12.
Second test case is 105 1001. The greatest common divisor of 105 and 1001 is 7. So, the second line of output is 7.
