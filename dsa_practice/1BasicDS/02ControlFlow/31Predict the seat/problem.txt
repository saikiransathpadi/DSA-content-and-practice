Predict the seat

A typical sleeper coach in Indian Railways contains 72 berths. The coach is divided into different blocks. Each block has the following pattern of berths: Lower - Middle - Upper - Lower - Middle - Upper - Side Lower - Side Upper. Berth number 1 is Lower, berth number 2 is Middle and so on. Write a program that predicts the berth type from the berth number.
Input

First line contains a positive integer n, denoting the number of test cases. It is followed by n lines. Each of the n lines contains two space separated positive integers c and b. c is the total number of berths in a coach and b is a berth number.
Output

n lines containing the type of berth of the corresponding test case. Berth type is defined as follows.

L for Lower
M for Middle
U for Upper
SL for Side Lower
SU for Side Upper
Invalid for invalid berth number

Example

Input:

3
72 8
72 42
56 28

Output:

SU
M
L

First line is 3, i.e. 3 test case.

First test case is 72 8. There are 72 berths and we are querying for berth number 8, which is a Side Upper. So we should print SU.

Second test case is 72 42. There are 72 berths and we are querying for berth number 42, which is a Middle. So we should print M.

Third test case is 56 28. There are 56 berths and we are querying for berth number 28, which is a Lower. So we should print L.
