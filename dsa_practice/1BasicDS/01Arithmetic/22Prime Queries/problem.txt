Prime queries

A prime number is defined as a number-

    which is not divisible by any number except 1 and itself.
    Smallest prime number is 2.

User makes Q queries, in each query a number is supplied. For each query, Count the number of prime numbers smaller than or equal to the query number. User also keeps a limit on the maximum number that can be provided in any of the query, which is given in the input.
Constraints

1<= Maximum Query number(Nmax)<= 100000

1<= number of queries<= 100000
Input

First line of the input contains two integers first representing the maximum query number(Nmax) and the number of queries(Q) respectively. Following Q lines contains an integer each representing the query number(N<= Nmax).
Output

For each query print the number of prime numbers smaller than or equal to the number.
Example

Input:

20 5

3

11

16

1

19

Output:

2

5

6

0

8

Explanation:

Primes less than equals 3 -> 2,3

Primes less than equals 11 -> 2,3,5,7,11

Primes less than equals 16 -> 2,3,5,7,11,13

Primes less than equals 1 -> No such number

Primes less than equals 19-> 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19

Note that 20 provided in the first line of the input makes sure that user wont provide any input >20.
