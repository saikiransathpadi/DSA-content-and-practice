Ringing Bells

There are N bells in a city. Each bell rings after a particular period of time(given in minutes). The period of each bell is provided in form of an array of integers. The moment when all the bells ring together is considered an auspicious moment by the people of the city and they take decisions on the basis of this. However, the people of the city are mathematically dumb and think it as a form of some sort of a magic. When you entered the city you saw all the bells ringing together. Lets say it was T=0(time). Can you use your knowledge of mathematics to predict how many minutes from T=0, would all the bells ring again?
