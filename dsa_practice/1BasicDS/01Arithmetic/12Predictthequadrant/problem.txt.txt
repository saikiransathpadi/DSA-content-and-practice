Predict the quadrant

Given a point on a two dimensional plane, predict the quadrant to which it belongs. Quadrants are named as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. Given a point P(x, y), quadrant of P is defined as follows.

Q1, if x > 0 and y > 0
Q2, if x < 0 and y > 0
Q3, if x < 0 and y < 0
Q4, if x > 0 and y < 0

Input

First line contains a positive integer n, denoting the number of test cases. It is followed by n lines. Each of the n lines contains two space separated integers x and y. Assume that neither x nor y is 0.
Output

n lines containing the quadrant to which the corresponding point belongs.
Example

Input:

2
2 -9
1 3

Output:

Q4
Q1

First line is 2, which means there are 2 test cases. Next 2 lines will contain one point each.

First point is (2, -9). It belongs to fourth quadrant, so we should print Q4.

Second point is (1, 3). It belongs to first quadrant, so we should print Q1.
