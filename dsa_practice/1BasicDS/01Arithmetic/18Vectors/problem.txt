Vectors

Given two force vectors, find out whether they are parallel, perpendicular or neither. Let the first vector be A = a1 i +a2 j + a3 k and the second vector be B = b1 i + b2 j + b3 k.

A.B = a1 x b1 + a2 x b2 + a3 x b3

A x B = (a2 x b3 - a3 x b2) i - (a1 x b3 - b1 x a3) j + (a1 x b2 - a2 x b1) k

|A|2 = a12 + a22 + a32

If A.B = 0, then A and B are perpendicular.

If |A X B| = 0, then A and B are parallel.
Input

First line contains three space seperate values denoting, a1, a2, a3 respectively. Second line contains three space seperate values denoting, b1, b2, b3 respectively.
Output

Print 1 if they are parallel to each other, 2 if they are perpendicular to each other and 0 otherwise.
Example

Input1:

3 2 1
6 4 2

Output1:

1

Explanation:

|A X B| = 0
